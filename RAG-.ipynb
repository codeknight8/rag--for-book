Nutrients are substances \\nrequired by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must \\nbe obtained from our diet, since the human body does not \\nsynthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three \\nbasic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, \\nand/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic \\nfunctions allow us to detect and respond to environmental \\nsurroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and \\nreproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body \\nto function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, \\nlipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain \\nnon-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common \\nin plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or \\nbeneficial (such as antioxidants). \\n4  |  Introduction'}, {'page_number': 5, 'page_char_count': 1742, 'page_word_count': 258, 'page_sentence_count_raw': 17, 'page_token_count': 435.5, 'text': 'Macronutrients \\nNutrients \\nthat \\nare \\nneeded \\nin \\nlarge \\namounts \\nare \\ncalled \\nmacronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients: \\ncarbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically \\nprocessed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients \\ncomes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is \\nconverted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, \\nallowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of \\nmeasurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels \\nthe amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie \\nmultiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, \\ndenoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a \\ncapital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in \\nthe sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other \\nmacronutrients, it does not yield calories. \\nCarbohydrates \\nCarbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and \\noxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk, \\nfruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables \\nalso contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates \\nare broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical \\nstructure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and \\ncomplex carbohydrates. \\nSimple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples \\nof simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have \\nin a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that \\ncirculates in your blood. \\nComplex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can \\nbe unbranched or branched.

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is \\nstored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber \\nis also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by \\ndigestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes \\nthrough the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that \\ninhabit the colon or large intestine break it down. \\nOne gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of \\nenergy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to \\nproviding energy and serving as building blocks for bigger \\nmacromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning \\nof the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose \\ncan be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage \\nmolecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is \\nknown as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates. \\nLipids \\nLipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, \\nand oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water. \\nLipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy \\nproducts, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three \\nmain \\ntypes \\nof \\nlipids \\nare \\ntriglycerides \\n(triacylglycerols), \\nphospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or \\nstore energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than \\ncarbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four \\nkilocalories per gram of carbohydrates).

There are five key factors that make \\nup a healthful diet: \\n1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of \\neach essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories. \\n2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient \\nat the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts \\nof all nutrients. \\n3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you \\nget from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of \\nenergy you expend during your day’s activities. \\n4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too \\nmuch nor too little. \\n5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each \\nof the food groups on a regular basis. \\nA healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative \\nto modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh \\nwhole foods that have been sustaining people for generations. \\nWhole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, \\ncarbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health. \\nCommercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients \\nand often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and \\ntrans fats, all of which are associated with the development of \\ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, \\nobesity, diabetes, and other illnesses.

In the \\nprocess of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built \\nup at a different site.

About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled \\neach year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting \\nupon them, even in adulthood. This phenomenon is called Wolff’s \\nlaw, which states that bones will develop a structure that is best \\nable to resist the forces acting upon them.

Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in \\nour brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific \\nprotein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects \\nthe levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase \\nin energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the \\nbrain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep. \\nAt high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and \\ninterferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as \\nshakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse \\neffects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at \\nmuch lower doses.

The American College of Sports Medicine \\nstates that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent \\ndehydration, which compromises performance and endurance. \\nThe primary source of water loss during intense physical activity \\nis sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many \\nfactors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and \\ntype of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal \\nendurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over-\\nhydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by \\nmeasuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in \\nweight will be the amount of water weight you lost. \\nThe primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat \\ncan contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium, \\nmagnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If \\nyou are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes, \\nit is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly \\naccomplished by consuming a sports drink.

The differences in chemical structure between the \\ndifferent carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. \\nStarches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making \\njam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, \\nand a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow-\\nreleasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture \\nto their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases \\nbulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but \\nalso to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the \\ncombination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as \\na glossy appearance and smooth texture. \\nDue to the potential health consequences of consuming too many \\nadded sugars, sugar substitutes have replaced them in many foods \\nand beverages.

So, normal fat reserves are a signal that metabolic processes \\nare efficient and a person is healthy. \\nLipids are a family of organic compounds that are mostly insoluble \\nin water. Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield \\nhigh energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon, \\nhydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological \\nfunctions within the body: they serve as structural components of \\ncell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as \\nimportant signaling molecules. \\nThe three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids, \\nand sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids \\nin the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil, \\nbutter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats. \\nNaturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including \\navocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides \\nin our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room \\ntemperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides \\ndo not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are \\ndiscretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when \\nwe use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides. \\nPhospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids. \\nThey are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals. \\nPhospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or \\nmembrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are \\nsynthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In \\nblood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is \\nenclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream. \\nSterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps \\nthe best well-known sterol.

While glycogen provides a ready source of \\nenergy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may \\nrecall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the \\nbody cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed \\ntogether tightly without water and store far greater amounts of \\nenergy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with \\nenergy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a \\ngram of carbohydrate.

When oxygen molecules \\nattack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes \\noxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives \\nthe food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can \\nundergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be \\nstored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to \\nminimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution \\nthat food manufacturers prefer. \\nWhen lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular \\nstructure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of \\nadding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the \\nhydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and \\nresults in a more saturated fatty acid. Liquid oils that once \\ncontained more unsaturated fatty acids become semisolid or solid \\n(upon complete hydrogenation) and behave like saturated fats.

Proteins \\nare crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life. \\nProteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just \\nas carbohydrates and lipids do, but proteins are the only \\nmacronutrient that contains nitrogen. In each amino acid the \\nelements are arranged into a specific conformation around a carbon \\ncenter.

Subsequently the child was fed watery \\nporridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low \\nprotein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of \\nthe feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low \\nmuscle mass, and liver malfunction.

The \\nRDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. \\nNitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino \\nacids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are \\ncatabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver \\nbreaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly \\nconverted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then \\ntransported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as \\nurea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are \\nalso lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, \\nis the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to \\nbalance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For \\nhealthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8 \\ngrams of protein per kilogram of body weight.

A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the \\nnitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A \\nperson is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted \\nnitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is \\nbreaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of \\nimbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such \\nas cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein \\ndiet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in \\nless protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance \\noccurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken \\nin by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these \\ntimes the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more \\nof what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A \\nperson healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen \\nbalance because protein is being used up to repair tissues. \\nDietary Sources of Protein \\nThe protein food group consists of foods made from meat, seafood, \\npoultry, eggs, soy, dry beans, peas, and seeds.

In the \\ncase of amino acids, once the nitrogen is removed from the amino \\nacid the remaining carbon skeleton can be enzymatically converted \\ninto acetyl-CoA or some other intermediate of the citric acid cycle. \\nAcetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule common to glucose, lipid, and \\nprotein metabolism enters the second stage of energy metabolism, \\nthe citric acid cycle. \\nIn the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is joined to a four-carbon \\nmolecule.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived \\nfoods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms \\nof vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes \\nreferred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant-\\nderived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in \\nthe body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin \\nA. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them \\ntheir yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids \\nhave been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found \\nin the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the \\nxanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do \\nnot. \\nIn plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and \\nact as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-\\ncryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body. \\nThe other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological \\nactions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity, \\nbut they likely act by other mechanisms, too. \\nVitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in \\nsmall intestine, and transported to the liver. The liver stores and \\nexports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a \\nretinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells.

Vitamins D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (calcitriol) are the \\nonly ones known to have biological actions in the human body. \\nThe skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In fact, \\nfor most people, more than 90 percent of their vitamin D3 comes \\nfrom the casual exposure to the UVB rays in sunlight. Anything \\nthat reduces your exposure to the sun’s UVB rays decreases the \\namount of vitamin D3 your skin synthesizes. That would include \\nlong winters, your home’s altitude, whether you are wearing \\nsunscreen, and the color of your skin (including tanned skin). Do you \\never wonder about an increased risk for skin cancer by spending too \\nmuch time in the sun? Do not fret. Less than thirty minutes of sun \\nexposure to the arms and legs will increase blood levels of vitamin \\nD3 more than orally taking 10,000 IU (250 micrograms) of vitamin \\nD3. \\nFigure 9.5 The Functions of Vitamin D \\n530  |  Fat-Soluble Vitamins'}, {'page_number': 531, 'page_char_count': 1098, 'page_word_count': 163, 'page_sentence_count_raw': 9, 'page_token_count': 274.5, 'text': 'Vitamin D’s Functional Role \\nActivated vitamin D3 (calcitriol) regulates blood calcium levels in \\nconcert with parathyroid hormone.

Although only 1 percent of \\nthe calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues, \\nit is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium \\nlevels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body \\nwill rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby \\nreleasing stored calcium into the blood. \\xa0Thus, bone tissue sacrifices \\nits stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone \\nhealth is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why \\nblood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake. \\nCalcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the \\nbody like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium \\nfunction is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that \\nwhen bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling \\nprocess, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the \\nosteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium \\nphosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium \\nsalts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your \\ndiet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases \\ncausing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium \\nintake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue. \\nGreater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD, \\nand to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role \\nin nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse \\ntransmission from one nerve cell to another.

For example, without calcium, the hormone \\ninsulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and \\nglycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to \\nprovide energy for muscle contraction. \\nMaintaining Calcium Levels \\nBecause calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood \\ncalcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid \\nhormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels \\nare low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three \\ndifferent mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium \\nstored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase \\ncalcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third, \\nPTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to \\ncalcitriol. \\xa0Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal \\ncells and increases dietary calcium absorption. When blood calcium \\nlevels become too high, the hormone calcitonin is secreted by \\ncertain cells in the thyroid gland and PTH secretion stops.\\xa0 At higher \\nnonphysiological concentrations, calcitonin lowers blood calcium \\nlevels by increasing calcium excretion in the urine, preventing \\nfurther absorption of calcium in the gut and by directly inhibiting \\nbone resorption. \\nFigure 10.2 Maintaining Blood Calcium Levels \\n614  |  Calcium'}, {'page_number': 615, 'page_char_count': 982, 'page_word_count': 148, 'page_sentence_count_raw': 6, 'page_token_count': 245.5, 'text': 'Image by \\nAllison \\nCalabrese / \\nCC BY 4.0 \\nOther Health Benefits of Calcium in the \\nBody \\nBesides forming and maintaining strong bones and teeth, calcium \\nhas been shown to have other health benefits for the body, \\nincluding: \\n• Cancer.

The \\nDRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even \\nif they were healthy previously. \\nDetermining Dietary Reference Intakes \\nEach DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an \\nexplanation of how each is determined: \\n1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is \\ndetermined by a committee of nutrition experts who review \\nthe scientific literature to determine a value that meets the \\nrequirements of 50 percent of people in their target group \\nwithin a given life stage and for a particular sex. The \\nrequirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and \\nthe other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for \\neach nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the \\ncriterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for \\ncalcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health. \\nThus, the EAR for calcium is set at a point that will meet the \\nneeds, with respect to bone health, of half of the population. \\nChemistry, 122(1), 267–70. \\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/\\nS0308814610001111.

Recommended Daily Allowances. Once the EAR of a nutrient \\nhas been established, the RDA can be mathematically \\ndetermined. While the EAR is set at a point that meets the \\nneeds of half the population, RDA values are set to meet the \\nneeds of the vast majority (97 to 98 percent) of the target \\nhealthy population. It is important to note that RDAs are not \\nthe same thing as individual nutritional requirements. The \\nactual nutrient needs of a given individual will be different \\nthan the RDA. However, since we know that 97 to 98 percent of \\nthe population’s needs are met by the RDA, we can assume that \\nif a person is consuming the RDA of a given nutrient, they are \\nmost likely meeting their nutritional need for that nutrient. \\nThe important thing to remember is that the RDA is meant as a \\nrecommendation and meeting the RDA means it is very likely \\nthat you are meeting your actual requirement for that nutrient. \\nUnderstanding the Difference \\nThere is a distinct difference between a requirement and a \\nrecommendation. For instance, the DRI for vitamin D is a \\nrecommended 600 international units each day. However, in order \\nto find out your true personal requirements for vitamin D, a blood \\ntest is necessary. The blood test will provide an accurate reading \\nfrom which a medical professional can gauge your required daily \\nvitamin D amounts. This may be considerably more or less than the \\nDRI, depending on what your level actually is. \\n1. Adequate Intake. AIs are created for nutrients when there is \\ninsufficient consistent scientific evidence to set an EAR for the \\nentire population.

Consequently, all of the \\nDRI values for infants are AIs derived from nutrient values in \\nhuman breast milk. For older babies and children, AI values are \\nderived from human milk coupled with data on adults. The AI is \\nmeant for a healthy target group and is not meant to be \\nsufficient for certain at-risk groups, such as premature infants. \\n2. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. The UL was established to help \\ndistinguish healthful and harmful nutrient intakes. Developed \\nin part as a response to the growing usage of dietary \\nsupplements, ULs indicate the highest level of continuous \\nintake of a particular nutrient that may be taken without \\ncausing health problems.

All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the \\ndietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the \\nserving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list \\nof selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the \\nfar right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good \\nsource of a particular nutrient or not. \\nThe Daily Value (DV) represents the recommended amount of \\na given nutrient based on the RDA of that nutrient in a \\n2,000-kilocalorie diet. The DV was updated as part of the new \\nnutrition facts label announced in May 2016. The updated DV applies \\nto packaged food, beverages and dietary supplements that contain \\ningredients with a DV.\\xa0The percentage of Daily Value (percent DV) \\nrepresents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount \\nthat you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the \\nolder food label in Figure 12.2 “Reading the Older Nutrition Label,” \\nthe percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese \\nis 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese \\nprovides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since \\nthe DV for calcium is 1,300 milligrams, the food producer \\ndetermined the percent DV for calcium by taking the calcium \\ncontent in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,300 \\nmilligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage \\nformat. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can \\nstill use the percent DV as a target reference. \\nGenerally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent \\nDV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat, \\nsaturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with \\na low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential \\nmineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure \\nout your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one \\nserving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat, \\nwhich is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent.

Most mothers can make enough milk for their \\nbabies whether they have small or large breasts. It is normal for a \\nwoman to have one breast that is different than the other in size \\nor shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in \\nsize. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during \\npregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or \\na lactation consultant. \\nAfter the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to \\nensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy \\ninto childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for \\nrapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends \\nthat breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first \\nsix months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the \\nbest ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health \\nof her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients \\nthat a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy \\nlife. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over \\n80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.

Proper nutrition \\nand adequate physical activity at this stage not only promote \\nwellness in the present, but also provide a solid foundation for the \\nfuture. \\nWith the onset of adulthood, good nutrition can help young adults \\nenjoy an active lifestyle. The body of an adult does not need to \\ndevote its energy and resources to support the rapid growth and \\ndevelopment that characterizes youth. However, the choices made \\nduring those formative years can have a lasting impact.

The energy \\nrequirements for people ages fifty-one and over are 1,600 to 2,200 \\ncalories for women and 2,000 to 2,800 calories for men, depending \\non activity level. The decrease in physical activity that is typical of \\nolder adults also influences nutritional requirements.

Older adults should substitute more unrefined \\ncarbohydrates for refined ones, such as whole grains and brown \\nrice.

Although following a gluten-free diet is \\nchallenging, it is prescribed for patients with gluten intolerance \\nand celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with a genetic link. \\nPeople who have celiac disease cannot consume gluten products \\nwithout damaging their intestinal lining. Eating a gluten-free diet \\nmeans finding replacements for bread, cereal, pasta, and more. It \\nalso means emphasizing fresh fruits, vegetables, and other foods \\nwithout gluten. However, it is important to note that the gluten-\\nfree trend has become something of a fad even for those without a \\ngluten intolerance. Celiac disease is a relatively rare condition found \\nin only 1 percent of the population. Therefore, a gluten-free diet \\nshould be followed only with a physician’s recommendation. \\nLow-Carb Diets \\nLow-carb diets, which include the Atkins Diet and the South Beach \\nDiet, focus on limiting carbohydrates—such as grains, fruit, and \\nstarchy vegetables—to promote weight loss.

Glutenin and gliadin are found in grains that \\nare commonly used to make bread, such as wheat, rye, and barley. \\nWhen bread is made, yeast eats the flour and makes a waste \\nproduct, carbon dioxide, which forms bubbles in the dough. As the \\ndough is kneaded, gluten forms and stretches. The carbon dioxide \\ngas bubbles infiltrate the stretchy gluten, giving bread its porosity \\nand tenderness. For those who are sensitive to gluten, it is good \\nto know that corn, millet, buckwheat, and oats do not contain the \\nproteins that make gluten. However, some people who have celiac \\ndisease also may have a response to products containing oats. This \\nis most likely the result of cross-contamination of grains during \\nharvest, storage, packaging, and processing. \\nCeliac disease is most common in people of European descent \\nand is rare in people of African American, Japanese, and Chinese \\ndescent. It is much more prevalent in women and in people with \\nType 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Down and Turner \\nsyndromes.

Celiac disease is not always diagnosed because the \\nsymptoms may be mild. A large number of people have what is \\nreferred to as “silent” or “latent” celiac disease. \\nCeliac disease diagnosis requires a blood test and a biopsy of the \\nsmall intestine. Because celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, \\nantibodies produced by white blood cells circulate in the body and \\ncan be detected in the blood. When gluten-containing foods are \\nconsumed the antibodies attack cells lining the small intestine \\nleading to a destruction of the small villi projections. This tissue \\ndamage can be detected with a biopsy, a procedure that removes a \\nportion of tissue from the damaged organ. Villi destruction is what \\ncauses many of the symptoms of celiac disease.

The only way to prevent the \\ndeadly symptoms of this disease is to inject insulin under the skin. \\nA person with Type 1 diabetes usually has a rapid onset of \\nsymptoms that include hunger, excessive thirst and urination, and \\nrapid weight loss.

A RD is a \\nhealthcare professional who has credentials from the Commission \\non Dietetic Registration and can provide nutritional care in the \\nareas of health and wellness for both individuals and groups. A \\nnutritionist is an unregistered professional who may have acquired \\nthe knowledge via other avenues. RDs are nutrition professionals \\nwho work to apply nutritional science, using evidence-based best \\npractices, to help people nourish their bodies and improve their \\nlives. \\nBecoming a RD requires a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in \\ndietetics from an accredited program, including courses in biology, \\nchemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy and physiology, \\nnutrition, and food-service management. Other suggested courses \\ninclude \\neconomics, \\nbusiness, \\nstatistics, \\ncomputer \\nscience, \\npsychology, and sociology. In addition, people who pursue this path \\nmust complete a dietetic internship and pass a national exam. Also, \\nsome states have licensure that requires additional forms and \\ndocumentation.

Therefore, reversing or  improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve  the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose  levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight,  losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial  demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200  and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less  than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150  minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved  a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances  of developing Type 2 diabetes.15  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that  provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the  question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA  recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and  set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose  levels in the target range.

Therefore, reversing or  improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve  the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose  levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight,  losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial  demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200  and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less  than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150  minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved  a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances  of developing Type 2 diabetes.15  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that  provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the  question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA  recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and  set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose  levels in the target range.

The Diabetes Prevention Trial  demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200  and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less  than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150  minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved  a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances  of developing Type 2 diabetes.15  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that  provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the  question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA  recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and  set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose  levels in the target range.
